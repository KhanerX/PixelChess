# PixelChess
A pixel art style smart chess I made for university AP project

Run the code with the following commandL:
g++ -c main.cpp && g++ main.o -o sfml-app -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system && ./sfml-app

Then Paste the chess state in the console to starta the game.

Smart detection of critical moves is NOT implemented.
